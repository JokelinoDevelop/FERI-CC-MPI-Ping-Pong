## 🚀 What You'll Learn

This project demonstrates:

- **Docker Containerization** - Lightweight virtual machines
- **SSH Security** - Key-based authentication and host verification
- **Network Configuration** - Private networks and IP assignment
- **Open MPI** - Message Passing Interface for distributed computing
- **Python Virtual Environments** - Isolated Python environments
- **Parallel Processing** - Running programs across multiple containers
- **Bash Scripting** - Automation and system administration
- **Cloud Computing Concepts** - Distributed computing and HPC

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Linux/Mac/Windows** with Docker installed
- **Basic terminal knowledge** (covered in guides)
- **N02 completed** (or understanding of SSH cluster setup)
- **15-45 minutes** to complete the tutorial

## 🎯 Project Goal

Extend the N02 SSH cluster by installing Open MPI in Python virtual environments and running a distributed PingPong program across 9 containers. The program demonstrates MPI communication patterns and distributed computing concepts.

## 📊 Expected Results

After running `./N03.txt`, you should see:

- ✅ 9 containers created successfully (ranks 0-8)
- ✅ Python virtual environments created in all containers
- ✅ mpi4py installed in all virtual environments
- ✅ PingPong program executed successfully
- ✅ Results printed to terminal
- ✅ `RESULT.TXT` file created with ping-pong count

**Example Output:**

```
Master (rank 0) starting PingPong with 8 clients...
Number of ping-pong message pairs: 8915

Results saved to RESULT.TXT:
Number of ping-pong message pairs: 8915
Final sum (modulo 360): 270.506406
```

## 📞 Support

2. **Check the troubleshooting guide** for common issues
3. **Review the FAQ** for quick answers
4. **Examine the script comments** for technical details

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project fulfills the N03 assignment requirements:

- ✅ **Extends N02** with Open MPI installation
- ✅ **Virtual environments** created in all containers
- ✅ **PingPong program** with 1 master (rank 0) + 8 clients (ranks 1-8)
- ✅ **Random floats** (0.00-180.00) sent from master to clients
- ✅ **Echo back** from clients to master
- ✅ **Sum modulo 360** accumulated on master
- ✅ **Loop until** sum is between 270.505 and 270.515
- ✅ **Print results** to terminal and `RESULT.TXT`
- ✅ **Merged script** (.txt format) with code, output, and description

## 🔗 Relationship to N02

N03 extends N02 by adding:

- Open MPI libraries and tools
- Python virtual environment setup
- MPI program execution
- Distributed computing demonstration

The base SSH cluster infrastructure from N02 is reused, demonstrating how projects build upon each other.

## 📋 Key Features

### Distributed Computing

- 9 MPI processes running across 9 containers
- Message passing between processes
- Coordinated execution

### Virtual Environments

- Isolated Python environments per container
- mpi4py installed for MPI bindings
- Clean dependency management

### PingPong Algorithm

- Demonstrates bidirectional communication
- Accumulates sum with modulo arithmetic
- Continues until target range is reached
